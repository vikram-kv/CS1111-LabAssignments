Program's Goal:-
	To print out the solutions of a pair of linear equations in two variables.

Instructions for compilation:-
1.Compile using the GCC compiler with std=c11 and run the .out file.
2.Input and output is from and on the terminal.

Sample Input and Output:-

A.
Enter the values of a,b,c for the 1th linear equation(of the form ax+by=c):2 3 5
Enter the values of a,b,c for the 2th linear equation(of the form ax+by=c):3 2 4

        The only solution is x=0.4000 and y=1.4000

B.
Enter the values of a,b,c for the 1th linear equation(of the form ax+by=c):2.0 4.0 6.0
Enter the values of a,b,c for the 2th linear equation(of the form ax+by=c):3.0 6.0 9.5

        You have no solutions.

C.
Enter the values of a,b,c for the 1th linear equation(of the form ax+by=c):4 5 10
Enter the values of a,b,c for the 2th linear equation(of the form ax+by=c):2 2.5 5

        You have infinitely many solutions. A few of which are x=1.0000,y=1.2000 and x=2.0000,y=0.4000
