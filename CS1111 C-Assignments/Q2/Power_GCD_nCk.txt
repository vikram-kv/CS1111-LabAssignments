Program's Goal:-
1.To compute x raised to the power of y through efficiently by storing values, where x and y are natural numbers.
2.To compute GCD of two natural numbers by recursive function call.
3.To compute nCk for natural numbers n and k efficiently by storing the requisite values in a pascal's triangle.

Instructions for compilation:-
1.Compile using gcc std c11 and run the .out file generated.
2.Presence of Input File pgb.txt is required.
3.Initially, pgb.txt contains a stream of characters and integers as shown below in the set of sample inputs.
