Program's Goal:
	To swap two integers in two ways.
		i) Using a temporary third variable.
		ii)Without using a third variable.

Instructions for compilation:-
1.Compile using the GCC compiler with std=c11 and run the .out file obtained.
2.Input and output is from and on terminal.

Sample Inputs with Outputs:-
A.
Enter two integers separated by a space:5 -2

Before swap,number 1=5,number 2=-2
After swap using a temporary variable,number 1=-2,number 2=5
After swap without a temporary variable,number 1=-2,number 2=5

B.
Enter two integers separated by a space:1 0

Before swap,number 1=1,number 2=0
After swap using a temporary variable,number 1=0,number 2=1
After swap without a temporary variable,number 1=0,number 2=1

C.
Enter two integers separated by a space:4 7

Before swap,number 1=4,number 2=7
After swap using a temporary variable,number 1=7,number 2=4
After swap without a temporary variable,number 1=7,number 2=4
