Program's Goal:
To solve the Towers of Hanoi Problem and print out the list of moves in a file.

Compilation Instruction:
1.Compile using gcc compiler with std=c11 and execute the .out file
2.Requires a non-negative integer as input which represents the number of disks to be moved in total.
3.Generates a .txt file named toh_output.txt which contains the output.

Set of Sample Inputs:-
Enter the total number of disks:
A.4
B.6
C.3

Corresponding Sample Outputs:-(in toh_output.txt)
