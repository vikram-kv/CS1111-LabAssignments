Program's Goal:
To be able to determine which strings are palindromes in a set of strings stored in a file by using static character arrays as strings
To achieve the same goal by creating a linked list of strings through dynamic memory allocation

Instructions for compilation:-
1.Compile using the GCC compiler with std=c11 and run the .out file obtained 
2.Input is obtained from palindrome.txt which must be in the same directory as the .out file
3.palindrome.txt contains text delimited by \n.
