Program's Goal:
To determine whether the columns of a given Matrix can be rearranged in a way such that all its rows have their elements in ascending order.
The program is solved by recursive function call.

Instructions for compilation:-
1.Compile using the GCC compiler with std=c11 and run the .out file
2.Input and output are from the terminal and on teh terminal respectively.
3.Requests the user to enter a 2D matrix.
4.Prints the output for that 2D Matrix.

Sample Input and Output:-


A.
Enter the dimensions of the matrix for which you want to know whether the columns can be rearranged in such a way that all the elements in any row are in ascending order:
3 3
Enter M[0][0]:1
Enter M[0][1]:0
Enter M[0][2]:0
Enter M[1][0]:1
Enter M[1][1]:1
Enter M[1][2]:0
Enter M[2][0]:2
Enter M[2][1]:1
Enter M[2][2]:1
1       0       0
1       1       0
2       1       1

The Input Matrix can , through column swapping ,be rearranged to a new matrix where elements in any given row are in ascending order.
The rearranged form is:
0       0       1
0       1       1
1       1       2


B.
Enter the dimensions of the matrix for which you want to know whether the columns can be rearranged in such a way that all the elements in any row are in ascending order:
3 3
Enter M[0][0]:1
Enter M[0][1]:2
Enter M[0][2]:3
Enter M[1][0]:6
Enter M[1][1]:5
Enter M[1][2]:4
Enter M[2][0]:2
Enter M[2][1]:2
Enter M[2][2]:2
1       2       3
6       5       4
2       2       2

 The input Matrix is not re-arrangeable.

C.
Enter the dimensions of the matrix for which you want to know whether the columns can be rearranged in such a way that all the elements in any row are in ascending order:
3 3
Enter M[0][0]:5
Enter M[0][1]:5
Enter M[0][2]:6
Enter M[1][0]:8
Enter M[1][1]:7
Enter M[1][2]:10
Enter M[2][0]:12
Enter M[2][1]:11
Enter M[2][2]:15
5       5       6
8       7       10
12      11      15

The Input Matrix can , through column swapping ,be rearranged to a new matrix where elements in any given row are in ascending order.
The rearranged form is:
5       5       6
7       8       10
11      12      15
