Program's Goal:
To perform Matrix Multiplication , when it is possible, of  two matrices and store them in a file.

Instructions for compilation:-
1.Compile using GCC compiler with std=c11 and execute the .out file obtained.
2.Output is printed in product.txt if it exists
3.User is required to enter the dimensions of two floating point matrices and assign the elements of the matrices valid values.

Sample Input(from terminal) and corresponding output:-


A.
Input:
Enter the number of rows and number of columns for the first matrix in that order(MAX 100):2 2
Enter MATRIX 1[0][0]:1
Enter MATRIX 1[0][1]:2
Enter MATRIX 1[1][0]:3
Enter MATRIX 1[1][1]:4
Enter the number of rows and number of columns for the second matrix in that order(MAX 100):2 2
Enter MATRIX 2[0][0]:1
Enter MATRIX 2[0][1]:2
Enter MATRIX 2[1][0]:3
Enter MATRIX 2[1][1]:4
Output:(in product.txt)
1.00	2.00	X	1.00	2.00	=	7.00	10.00	
3.00	4.00		3.00	4.00		15.00	22.00

	
B.
Illegal Input:
Enter the number of rows and number of columns for the first matrix in that order(MAX 100):2 2
Enter MATRIX 1[0][0]:g
You have not entered a valid floating point array.Quitting


C.
Input:
Enter the number of rows and number of columns for the first matrix in that order(MAX 100):2 2
Enter MATRIX 1[0][0]:1
Enter MATRIX 1[0][1]:2
Enter MATRIX 1[1][0]:1
Enter MATRIX 1[1][1]:3
Enter the number of rows and number of columns for the second matrix in that order(MAX 100):1 2
Enter MATRIX 2[0][0]:1
Enter MATRIX 2[0][1]:2
Output:(in terminal)
Can't Multiply.
