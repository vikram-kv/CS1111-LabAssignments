Program's Goal:-
	To compute the average of a few selected continguous integers of an integer array through iteration and recursion.

Instructions for compilation:-
1.Compile using the GCC compiler with std=c11 and run the .out file obtained.
2.Input and output is from and on terminal.

Sample Input and Output:-

A.
Enter the number of elements in the array:5
1 2 3 4 5

 Enter the value of the starting position and ending position in that order:1 5

The average of the selected elements in the array is(calculated through iteration):3.000000
The average of the selected elements in the array is(calculated through recursion):3.000000

B.
Enter the number of elements in the array:4
4 2 6 8

 Enter the value of the starting position and ending position in that order:2 3

The average of the selected elements in the array is(calculated through iteration):4.000000
The average of the selected elements in the array is(calculated through recursion):4.000000

C.
Enter the number of elements in the array:10
1 4 2 5 6 3 7 5 8 9

 Enter the value of the starting position and ending position in that order:2 7

The average of the selected elements in the array is(calculated through iteration):4.500000
The average of the selected elements in the array is(calculated through recursion):4.500000
